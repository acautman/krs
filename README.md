# krsâ€”Kubernetes resource stats

`krs` is a command line tool for capturing and serializing Kubernetes resource statistics in [OpenMetrics](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics) format. It dumps statistics about Kubernetes resources, for example the number of pods in a certain namespace, on a periodic basis to local storage. The kind of resources (pods, services, etc.) as well as the scope, that is, cluster-level or a list of namespaces, is configurable. You can use `krs` either on the client-side (for example, from your laptop) or in-cluster, like in a deployment. Note that `krs` leaves the decision where and how long-term storage is carried out up to you.

## Install

For the time being, assumes you've got Go v1.10 or above installed and then:

```shell
$ go get -u github.com/mhausenblas/krs
```

Binaries and container image to follow soon.

## Use

```shell
$ krs >> /tmp/krs/2018-10-05.json
```

## Config

`krs` assumes `kubectl` is installed and configured. It writes the OpenMetrics data to `stdout` which you can redirect to a file or process further.
